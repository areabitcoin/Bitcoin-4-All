Hello! Welcome to Bitcoin4All, a free and open source course created by Area Bitcoin. If you're here, it's because you've heard about Bitcoin and want to know more about how it works. And guess what? You are in the right place!

Our goal with Bitcoin4All is to help you understand the Bitcoin and inspire you to be a multiplier of this knowledge. We want anyone, regardless of their level of knowledge or training, to be able to learn about this money and revolutionary technology in a simple, direct and practical way.

You will realize that Bitcoin is much more than numbers on a screen: it is about freedom, sovereignty and the chance to participate in a fairer, decentralized and resilient financial system. And the best part? All course material is available for you and any educator in the world to use as you wish, because we believe that sharing knowledge is as important as learning.

As Bitcoin4All is open source, it goes beyond a simple course. It's a tool that you can use to teach other people, organize meetings like meetups, create your own videos or even customize materials for your reality. Under the Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license, you have the freedom to adapt everything -- as long as credit is given to Bitcoin4All from Area Bitcoin and with the condition that it is used for educational purposes, never commercial, ok?

We believe that knowledge about Bitcoin needs to be universal and accessible to everyone, because it is a powerful tool to change lives. So it doesn't matter if you're just starting out or already understand a little about the subject, Bitcoin4All is designed to make you feel part of this revolution.

### But how will Bitcoin4All work?

1. What is Bitcoin and why was it created?

2. The problem with fiat money

3. Why Bitcoin is better money

4. Inside Bitcoin: decentralization, blockchain and game theory

5. Inside Bitcoin: mining, halving and cycles

6. Why does Bitcoin tend to continue to appreciate?

7. How to have bitcoin: Exchange, p2p or circular economies

8. Rebutting lies (fuds) about Bitcoin

9. Why do self-custody and what are Bitcoin wallets?

10. How to withdraw from the Exchange and have sovereignty over your Bitcoin?


All files -- videos, slides and other materials -- are available on the areabitcoin.co website and also on Area Bitcoin's GitHub. You can access everything in a practical and free way, whether to learn, share or teach.
